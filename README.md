# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a demo web page(ETELAB) where navigation bar redirects to another page with `react-router`.

Using this demo website, you can search information getting data from another server with `http-proxy-middleware`.

All UI components in this React SPA project are `MUI` components.
